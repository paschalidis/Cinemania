## Stage 1:  Main Discovery Screen, A Details View, and Settings

### User Experience

In this stage you’ll build the core experience of your movies app.
Your app will:
  * Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
  * Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
  * The sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  * original title
  * movie poster image thumbnail
  * A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  * user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  * release date
  
## Stage 2:  Trailers, Revies and Favorites

### User Experience

In this stage you’ll add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.
You’ll add more information to your movie details view:
  * You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
  * You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
  * You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request.
  * You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
  
## The Movie Database API
To fetch movies, you will use the API from themoviedb.org you will need to [create](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) an account in order to request an API KEY. More details in [API Documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started)

Finaly you will need to add your API KEY in [USER_HOME]/.gradle/grandle.properties file : MyTheMovieDbApiToken = "YOUR_API_KEY" variable.
